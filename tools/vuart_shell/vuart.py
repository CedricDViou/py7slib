class VUART_shell():
    '''
    This class provides an interactive shell to handle the VUART_bridge driver.

    It adds an abstraction layer over the VUART driver in order to show the user
    an interface like when connected through serial connection. It provides
    an interactive shell with a prompt where the user could insert the WRPC commands.

    Interactive commands (such as gui or stat cont) keeps the "ESC" key to stop
    the data output from the device. The shell can be closed using the key
    combination "ctrl-q".
