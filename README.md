Introduction
============

The **py7slib_py3** repository hosts the python3 version of the **py7slib** repository of open Python libraries developed by SevenSolutions.


Disclamer
=========

This project was ported to python3 and tested only for :
- the shell binary
- VUART_shell functions
- etherbone lib interface for arch x86_64

More tests are probably required for full compatibility with original python 2 implementation...

Installation
============

```
git clone <repos-URL> <local-dir>
cd <local-dir>
pip install .
```
